who has the highest score, what is the average score 

```python
from csv import reader
with open('grades.csv') as fid:
	read = reader(fid)
	arr = [(score, name) for name, score in read]
	arr2 = [(len(name),name)for name, _ in arr]
	arr3 = [int(score)for name, score in arr]
	vowels = 'auoiye'
	arr4 = [(sum([1 for i in nmae if i in vowels]),name)for name, score in arr]
print(arr)[1]
print(arr2)[1]
print(sum(arr3) / len(arr3))
print(max(arr4))

```


```python
def countVowels(name):
	count = 0
	for i in name:
		if i in 'aieyou':
			count += 1
	return count

with open('grades.csv') as fid:
	read = reader(fid)
	arr1 = []
	arr2 = []
	arr3 = []
	arr4 = []
	for name, score in read:
		arr1.append( (int(score), name) )
		arr2.append( (len(name), name) )
		arr3.append( (int(score)) )
		arr4.append( (countVowels(name), name) )

print(max(arr1))
print(max(arr2))
print(sum(arr3) / len(arr3))
print(max(arr4))
```
